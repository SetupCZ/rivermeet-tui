import { Steps, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Rivermeet TUI is a terminal application for browsing and editing Confluence pages with vim-style navigation.

## Setting Up Confluence API Access

<Steps>

1. **Get your API token**

   Go to [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) and create a new API token.

2. **Set environment variables**

   ```bash
   export ATLASSIAN_BASE_URL="https://your-domain.atlassian.net"
   export ATLASSIAN_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
   export ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
   ```

   <Aside type="tip">
     Add these to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or shell config file for persistence.
   </Aside>

3. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   bunx rivermeet-tui
   ```

</Steps>

## First Launch

When you first launch the app, you'll see the **Tree View** showing your Confluence spaces:

- Use `j`/`k` to move up and down
- Press `l` or `Enter` to expand a space and view its pages
- Press `l` or `Enter` again on a page to open it
- Press `q` to quit

<Aside>
  Pages are cached locally in `~/.cache/rivermeet-tui/` for faster subsequent loads.
